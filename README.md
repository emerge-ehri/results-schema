# eMERGE-Seq XML Format Schema

Schema used within the [eMERGE network](https://emerge.mc.vanderbilt.edu/) for the return of structured sequencing results.

Some elements within the schema have coded concepts, which are defined by pre-existing value sets where possible.  [Additional documentation](doc/CodedConcepts.md) describes which elements and value sets are used.

For example XML documents, please see the [examples folder](examples/README.md).
